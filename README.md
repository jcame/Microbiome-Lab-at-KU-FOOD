# Microbiome_Lab_at_FOOD-KU (MILAF)

Introduction

MILAF is a respository that contains multiple examples of microbiome data (previously published by FOOD-KU microbiome geeks) and analyses. 
We think  that with this repository we can provide the minimun set of tools needed to start and explore microbiome datasets within BSc and MSc projects at FOOD-KU and collaborators. The key features of MILAF are:

    Alpha-Diversity analysis – observed species, Shannon index, Chao1 (incl. t-test, Kruskal-Wallis)
    Beta-diversity analysis – Phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic | weighted and unweighted distances (incl. ANOSIM, ADONIS, PERMANOVA, db-RDA)
    Variable selection – Multiple t-test, multiple Kruskal-Wallis, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), univariate correlation (Pearson, Spearman's rank)
    Plotting your own data – PCoA plots (scatter plots), boxplots, heatmaps
    

By nature every dataset is different from each other and therefore, we cannot come up with a "universal" analysis are to all datasets. Instead, base of these examples we hope to give you a glance of the different analysis (and combination of them) that you could apply to your data in order to maxize the biological meaning of it.
