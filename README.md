# Basic of Microbiome Analysis at KU-FOOD (BAC-FOOD)

# Introduction

BAC-FOOD is a respository that contains a general workflow of microbiome analysis (it does not include handling of DNA/RNA sequences, but rather what to do with an abundance table.
We think that with this repository we can provide the minimun/basic set of tools needed to start and explore microbiome datasets within BSc and MSc projects at KU-FOOD and other departments, where computational microbiology is not the main focus. The key features of BAC-FOOD are:

    Summarizing Microbiome Data (e.g. zOTU level and/or species level, rarefying for sequencing depth).
    
    Alpha-Diversity analysis (Observed Species, Shannon and Simpson indexes, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, etc.). 
    
    Beta-diversity analysis (Weighted and unweighted distances, and analyses based on ANOSIM, ADONIS, db-RDA [distance-based Redundancy Anaysis])
    
    Variable selection (Multiple t-test, multiple Kruskal-Wallis and univariate correlation (Pearson, Spearman's rank)
    
    There are a bunch of multivariate tools (a.k.a machine learning or AI) to carry out feature selection (e.g. PLS-DA, RandomForest, Support Vector Machine, etc), but          this is not the main focus of this repository       

By nature every dataset is different and therefore, we cannot come up with an "universal" analysis are to all datasets. Instead, with this workflow we hope to give you a glance of the different analysis (and combination of them) that you could apply to your data in order to maxize and extract the biological meaning from it.
