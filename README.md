# Microbiome_Lab_at_FOOD-KU (MILAF)

Introduction

MILAF is a respository that contains multiple examples of microbiome data (previously published by FOOD-KU microbiome geeks) and analyses, which may serve the basis for attacking microbiome studies within BSc and MSc projects at FOOD-KU. The key features are:

    Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-20,000x speed of BLAST.
    Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
    Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard desktops or laptops.
    Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML, as well as taxonomic classification.
